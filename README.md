# London Bike Sharing Analysis

This project is an end-to-end data analyst portfolio project showcasing the processes of data gathering, exploration, manipulation, and visualization. 

**Data Source:** Public London bicycle sharing dataset from Kaggle.

**Key Features:**

* **Data Acquisition:** Programmatically downloads the data using Python libraries from Kaggle.
* **Data Exploration & Assessment:** Utilizes pandas to explore and assess the data, including:
    * Identifying missing values
    * Determining data types
    * Calculating summary statistics
* **Data Manipulation:** Cleans and prepares data for visualization using pandas, including:
    * Renaming columns
    * Handling missing values
    * Creating new calculated fields
* **Data Visualization:** Creates five Tableau visualizations:
    * Total bike rides
    * Moving average of bike rides
    * Heatmap of temperature vs. wind speed
    * Number of bike rides by weather and hour (tooltip)
    * Number of bike rides by hour (tooltip)
* **Interactive Dashboard:**
    * User-defined parameters allow control of the moving average period.
    * Set actions link the moving average chart to other visualizations for interactive exploration.
* **Methodology:**
    1. Data Download (Kaggle API)
    2. Data Exploration & Assessment (pandas)
    3. Data Manipulation (pandas)
    4. Data Visualization (Tableau)
    5. Dashboard Design (interactive features)
* **Insights:**
    * Understands patterns and trends in London bike sharing.
    * Analyzes changes in ridership over time with the moving average chart.
    * Examines the relationship between ridership, temperature, and wind speed with the heatmap.
* **Impact:**
    * Serves as a portfolio project for data analysts, showcasing their skills.
    * Provides a learning resource for using Python and Tableau for data analysis.
